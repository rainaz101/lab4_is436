Our project is to create a new and improved version of the myUMBC degree planner. We want the planner to be easier to use and have AI 
assistance to provide improvements, suggestions, and notes for the students as they create their plans, to ensure their success in graduating
on time, or at the pace they want. The project uses a PostgreSQL 15 database inside a Docker container to manage student, advisor, an degree planning data. 
We created SQL code to create and insert data we need to for the project.
